      <ExtraPageLayout title="About Us">
         <p className="text-[18px]">Welcome to our secret confession website, a platform for sharing your deepest thoughts and feelings about your secret crush or love. Here, you can anonymously confess your innermost desires, whether it's a crush on your coworker, a love for your best friend, or a long-standing attraction to someone you've never met.
         <br />
         <br />
         We understand that sometimes it's not easy to talk about our feelings, especially when they're about someone we're not supposed to have feelings for. Our website provides a safe and judgment-free space for you to express yourself without fear of repercussions or embarrassment. You can rest assured that your confession will remain anonymous and will not be shared with anyone else.
         <br />
         <br />
         Our mission is to help people relieve themselves of the burden of their secret emotions, as we believe that keeping these feelings bottled up can be detrimental to one's mental and emotional wellbeing. By allowing people to share their secrets with others who can relate, we hope to create a supportive community where people can feel comfortable being vulnerable and honest.
         <br />
         <br />
         We believe that everyone deserves to have a place where they can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or ridicule. Our website is open to people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds, and we encourage everyone to share their thoughts and feelings with us.
         <br />
         We take privacy very seriously, and we will never share your personal information with anyone. We use industry-standard encryption to ensure that your confession remains secure and confidential.
         <br />
         <br />
         Thank you for choosing our website as your platform to share your secret confessions. We hope that you find solace in knowing that you're not alone, and we look forward to hearing from you.
